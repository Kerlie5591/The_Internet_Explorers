  <h1> Project Idea - Versatile Fitness </h1>
  <h3> An exercise app for time-constrained parents </h3>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Overview </h3>
  <br>			
  <p> My project idea is an everyday workout smartphone app that is affordable, targeting busy parents. The app will focus on time-sensitive 
  parents that struggle with the motivation to exercise when they have a busy schedule. This appeals to me because I have always enjoyed exercising 
  and since having our first child, I have noticed that most of my time is spent prioritising her needs rather than my health. This doesn’t allow 
  for much time when I incorporate working, household chores, family time, and study. I feel an app that has an effective workout routine for 10 minutes 
  or under each day will be of great benefit to parents everywhere. </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Motivation </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> A current study concluded that only 17.6% of parents exercised regularly, this can be attributed to many factors, the biggest one being parents 
  saying they would prefer to spend their free time interacting with their children (Sukys et al. 2014). As cited by Samataro (2015), a recent study 
  from the University of Pittsburgh revealed that couples or singles without children were less sedentary than parents. This is a problem as children’s 
  fitness levels, which are vitally important to their personality development, are closely attributed to their parent’s exercise habits (Sukys et al. 2014). 
  Samataro (2015) believes this issue is due to the commitments, prioritisation, and unpredictability of parenting. This results in parents finding it 
  difficult to create and maintain a schedule, often neglecting exercise. Our project offers a solution by providing a time-effective workout routine with 
  varying intensities that can include children. The features of the app will allow parents to easily slot exercise into their busy days and help provide 
  motivation through motivational quotes/pictures, and an advanced notification system. The biggest drawback I foresee is visibility, there are currently 
  similar apps, and they may not have all the same features, but they have been in the market for a while, making it harder to convince people that our 
  app will be beneficial. </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Description </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> The Versatile Fitness application aims to have a user-friendly interface that initially guides the user through the experience of finding the right 
  workout for them. The first time a user opens the application they are asked a sequence of questions with one question per screen. These will include age, 
  weight, height, experience level, fitness goals, time restraints, and if the user would like to involve their children in their workouts, note that these 
  can be changed at any time within the app. The user can choose to go with the exercise program that is suggested by Versatile Fitness based on the 
  introductory questions, or they can pick from the in-app selection of expertly curated programs sorted by time constraints, experience level and child 
  involvement. Once a workout routine has been selected the user will see an overview screen outlining each exercise, the number of repetitions, the time 
  taken per exercise, and the time taken for the entire routine. On the pre-workout screen there will be a large ‘start’ button which will take the user to 
  the exercise introduction screen. Before each exercise there will be an informational screen that displays the basic movements of the exercise in gif 
  format, the number of exercises left in the workout routine will also be displayed here. There will also be a link to a more in-depth video tutorial of the 
  specific exercise which if chosen will show a workout that is designed to engage children and adults. This exercise introduction screen will have a countdown 
  until the exercise starts automatically allowing the user to prepare themselves. Once the exercise starts there will be a timer based on the difficulty level 
  and repetitions per exercise, which are set depending on the workout selection process, but can be changed at any time in the settings. There will also be 
  a ‘previous’, ‘pause’ and ‘next’ button at the bottom of the exercise screen. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The Versatile Fitness app will also allow users to link their account to their favourite social media platforms through a button located in the settings. 
  This button will appear as a small cog in the top right-hand corner of the main screen. This will allow the option to share the details of the user’s completed 
  workouts on social media, showing simple information like the time it took to complete, the intensity of that workout, and a motivational graphic, picture, or 
  quote. Suggested social media options to offer connection to, based on popularity, would be Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram. When the user wants 
  to share content for the first time, they select the social media site they want to post to, the login page to that site will then open so that the user can 
  connect the two. The ability to add a comment to the post will be available as well as a list with checkboxes of the information they would like to post. For 
  example, the user can choose to just share the name of the workout and the overall time for completion, or they can include all the details of the workout 
  including their own comments. The user will be offered the option to keep the two apps linked for future posting, avoiding the need to login again. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The app will include an options menu so that the user can personalise the audio and visual aspects, notification settings, and workout intensity level. 
  The user can personalise the display with a few colour and style themes on offer. The volume of the background music and general audio can be raised or dimmed 
  to suit the user’s preferences. They can also select their workout intensity with selections ranging from beginner, easy, medium, and hard. All of this will be 
  in a clean, easy to read format. They can also change the frequency of notification settings and choose if they would like a picture, graphic, quote, or just a 
  standard notification to accompany the alert sound, offering a handful of basic sound options.   </p>
  <br>
  <p> Due to the busy schedule parents manage, this app will come with an advanced notification system which will remind the user multiple times throughout the 
  day. However, instead of repetitive or even at times irritating notifications, these notifications will have inspirational and motivational quotes. These 
  inspirational quotes may prompt the users into the motivation they need to start the workout despite being tired or busy. Users have the choice to pre-set their 
  workout times and the notifications will start ringing before the set time to stimulate the users before the workout begins. Notifications will also be sent when 
  the workout has been scheduled so the user will not forget to start their workout. Notifications will also include the progress of the user, including commendations 
  for their achievements and a reminder of how close they are towards reaching their next goal. Versatile Fitness app will include a goal system which will be 
  created by how many days and the duration they exercise for. Consecutive days of workouts will boost the points higher, helping them to complete a level. The 
  difficulty of the workouts will increase gradually with the intensity of the workout and how many times they workout.  </p>
  <br>
  <p> Users can decide to make their progress and achievements private or public and share it on the forum available to all users on the main screen of the app. 
  The purpose of this forum will be for users to share their progress with everyone and encourage each other to keep going. Users can interact with each other about 
  their challenges and struggles, how they have overcome such challenge, what schedule works for them or what doesn’t and have the option share workout videos with 
  themselves and their children. This could motivate other parents who are starting off or going through a slump to pick up and continue. Further, this forum could 
  promote the fun sides of working out, especially participating with children together. Workouts will have an automatic save function when each workout is completed 
  as well as the user’s progress. If the user decides to create an account, they can save their progress onto the cloud storage to back it up. This means the user 
  can use multiple devices with their account and keep their progress. Also, if the user loses the data on their app, since the cloud storage will still have the 
  data that was saved, the user can restore their lost data at any time. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> NOAH - insert text </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Versatile Fitness will include a unique function to incorporate children that may be joining their parents in the selected workout. This feature will 
  be available via a prompt asking if any children will be working out with you; after you select your desired workout from the main workout page. If you 
  select “no”, the workout you selected will begin. However, if you select “yes”, a list will appear of pre-set workouts you can choose from that are more 
  child friendly. This means that exercises such as running in place, jumping movements, and other movements that can potentially be dangerous If a child 
  gets too close, will be removed from the workout and replaced with more static exercises. Furthermore, there will be a history page from the main screen 
  for viewing your workout history. It will include a list that has the date, time, the name of the pre-selected or custom workout, intensity, workout length, 
  if any exercises were skipped, and if a child was working out with you. There will be a graph when you first open the page that combines your data and 
  displays it in a way to show your progress, so you can see how far you have come. Another vital feature is an automated voice that announces the workout 
  name and the reps to be completed when you start an exercise or select the next button. This feature is to allow the user to focus on the exercises rather 
  than needing to stare at the screen while working out. The final feature will allow the user to run a music app in the background such as Spotify. This 
  feature will allow music to play during your workout without cutting off the music when the app has sound output. Instead, the app’s sound output will be 
  100% volume (as selected by mobile devices sound settings), and the music player’s sound output will dim to 50% of total volume during the announcement.  </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> To create this smartphone app, multiple tools are required. This includes a computer that can run the software required to develop the app, a 
  knowledgeable fitness professional, and an internet connection capable of decent download/upload speeds. The software I will need will be an Integrated 
  Development Environment (IDE) that is specifically designed to develop Android apps and is compatible with both Kotlin and Java programming language, 
  such as Android Studio, as these are the only languages that I have basic knowledge in. An IDE “enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects 
  of writing a computer program” (Codecademy 2021, para. 2). </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Skills Required </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> The main skills required for this project will include advanced programming skills with knowledge in Java and Kotlin programming languages 
  (Percival & Stock 2021). An understanding of how Android Studio operates and how to navigate this software would also be of importance. The team’s current level 
  of experience with Java and Kotlin, and experience with Studio, are basic to minimal. A quick online search shows that there are paid courses in everything 
  required as well as free YouTube videos on the topics, all which should aid in the creation of the Versatile Fitness app. The online courses available teach 
  everything from the basic skills necessary to advanced options. With a bit of extra study and lots of practice the team believe that attaining the skills required 
  for this project will be plausible. A basic understanding of fitness and workout routines would also be an advantage but as the team would be working with an 
  experienced Personal Trainer or Fitness Instructor in the creation of the workout videos then that knowledge can also be learned. </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Outcome </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> As previously mentioned, many parents choose to neglect fitness within their busy schedules and find it difficult to create and maintain a workout routine. 
  Also, as much as fitness is important for parents promoting a healthier lifestyle it is important to children in developing their personality. Hence, if this 
  project is successful, busy parents could use this app to achieve their fitness goals, step by step, whether it be weight loss, being more active, or adding to 
  their current exercise routines so they could spend more time with their kids. Parents will not feel the pressure to be away from their children, especially if 
  they are younger in age, to exercise. Rather, this app will encourage parents to exercise in the space and time they have, and the equipment available to them 
  while spending time with their children. The features of this app will assist in eliminating the original problems of time limitations or motivation to become 
  more active and start exercising. We believe the overall impact will be more active parents that are less sedentary, healthier, and happier with their body 
  image. This in turn will promote children to be more active and will support a healthy home environment. </p>
