  <h1> Project Idea - Versatile Fitness </h1>
  <h3> An exercise app for time-constrained parents </h3>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Overview </h3>
  <br>			
  <p> My project idea is an everyday workout smartphone app that is affordable, targeting busy parents. The app will focus on time-sensitive 
  parents that struggle with the motivation to exercise when they have a busy schedule. This appeals to me because I have always enjoyed exercising 
  and since having our first child, I have noticed that most of my time is spent prioritising her needs rather than my health. This doesn’t allow 
  for much time when I incorporate working, household chores, family time, and study. I feel an app that has an effective workout routine for 10 minutes 
  or under each day will be of great benefit to parents everywhere. </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Motivation </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> A current study concluded that only 17.6% of parents exercised regularly, this can be attributed to many factors, the biggest one being parents 
  saying they would prefer to spend their free time interacting with their children (Sukys et al. 2014). As cited by Samataro (2015), a recent study 
  from the University of Pittsburgh revealed that couples or singles without children were less sedentary than parents. This is a problem as children’s 
  fitness levels, which are vitally important to their personality development, are closely attributed to their parent’s exercise habits (Sukys et al. 2014). 
  Samataro (2015) believes this issue is due to the commitments, prioritisation, and unpredictability of parenting. This results in parents finding it 
  difficult to create and maintain a schedule, often neglecting exercise. Our project offers a solution by providing a time-effective workout routine with 
  varying intensities that can include children. The features of the app will allow parents to easily slot exercise into their busy days and help provide 
  motivation through motivational quotes/pictures, and an advanced notification system. The biggest drawback I foresee is visibility, there are currently 
  similar apps, and they may not have all the same features, but they have been in the market for a while, making it harder to convince people that our 
  app will be beneficial. </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Description </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> The Versatile Fitness application aims to have a user-friendly interface that initially guides the user through the experience of finding the right 
  workout for them. The first time a user opens the application they are asked a sequence of questions with one question per screen. These will include age, 
  weight, height, experience level, fitness goals, time restraints, and if the user would like to involve their children in their workouts, note that these 
  can be changed at any time within the app. The user can choose to go with the exercise program that is suggested by Versatile Fitness based on the 
  introductory questions, or they can pick from the in-app selection of expertly curated programs sorted by time constraints, experience level and child 
  involvement. Once a workout routine has been selected the user will see an overview screen outlining each exercise, the number of repetitions, the time 
  taken per exercise, and the time taken for the entire routine. On the pre-workout screen there will be a large ‘start’ button which will take the user to 
  the exercise introduction screen. Before each exercise there will be an informational screen that displays the basic movements of the exercise in gif 
  format, the number of exercises left in the workout routine will also be displayed here. There will also be a link to a more in-depth video tutorial of the 
  specific exercise which if chosen will show a workout that is designed to engage children and adults. This exercise introduction screen will have a countdown 
  until the exercise starts automatically allowing the user to prepare themselves. Once the exercise starts there will be a timer based on the difficulty level 
  and repetitions per exercise, which are set depending on the workout selection process, but can be changed at any time in the settings. There will also be 
  a ‘previous’, ‘pause’ and ‘next’ button at the bottom of the exercise screen. </p>

  <br>	
  <p> Versatile Fitness will include a unique function to incorporate children that may be joining their parents in the selected workout. This feature will 
  be available via a prompt asking if any children will be working out with you; after you select your desired workout from the main workout page. If you 
  select “no”, the workout you selected will begin. However, if you select “yes”, a list will appear of pre-set workouts you can choose from that are more 
  child friendly. This means that exercises such as running in place, jumping movements, and other movements that can potentially be dangerous If a child 
  gets too close, will be removed from the workout and replaced with more static exercises. Furthermore, there will be a history page from the main screen 
  for viewing your workout history. It will include a list that has the date, time, the name of the pre-selected or custom workout, intensity, workout length, 
  if any exercises were skipped, and if a child was working out with you. There will be a graph when you first open the page that combines your data and 
  displays it in a way to show your progress, so you can see how far you have come. Another vital feature is an automated voice that announces the workout 
  name and the reps to be completed when you start an exercise or select the next button. This feature is to allow the user to focus on the exercises rather 
  than needing to stare at the screen while working out. The final feature will allow the user to run a music app in the background such as Spotify. This 
  feature will allow music to play during your workout without cutting off the music when the app has sound output. Instead, the app’s sound output will be 
  100% volume (as selected by mobile devices sound settings), and the music player’s sound output will dim to 50% of total volume during the announcement.  </p>

  <h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> To create this smartphone app, multiple tools are required. This includes a computer that can run the software required to develop the app, a 
  knowledgeable fitness professional, and an internet connection capable of decent download/upload speeds. The software I will need will be an Integrated 
  Development Environment (IDE) that is specifically designed to develop Android apps and is compatible with both Kotlin and Java programming language, 
  such as Android Studio, as these are the only languages that I have basic knowledge in. An IDE “enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects 
  of writing a computer program” (Codecademy 2021, para. 2). </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Skills Required </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> The main skills required for my project will include advanced programming skills, knowledge in Java and Kotlin programming languages 
  (Percival & Stock 2021), and an understanding of different workout routines. I will need to understand how Android Studio operates and how to navigate this 
  software. I currently have very basic knowledge with both programming languages and the software required. I think it will be easy to discover courses 
  online that teach beginners how to improve their coding skills using Java and Kotlin. With a bit of extra study and lots of practice I believe attaining 
  the skills required for this project will be plausible. </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Outcome </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> If my project is successful, busy parents will be able to use my app to help them achieve their fitness goals, whether it be weight loss, being more 
  active, or add to their current exercise routines. With the included features of my app, the original problem of time limitations or motivation to become 
  more active and start exercising, will be a thing of the past. I believe the overall impact will be more active parents that are less sedentary, heathier 
  and are happier with their body image, and this in turn will promote their children to be more active. </p>
