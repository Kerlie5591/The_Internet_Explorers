	Our video interview with a Software Developer, Joel, was very informative and provided a strong insight of what it’s like to work in his field. Joel 
	works for a company called Bigtincan, a sales enablement platform. His job as a Software Developer is to design and create web API’s, make them publicly 
	accessible for clients to create their own tools with, and for the company to use in their own applications. Joel works for the Hobart branch, the main 
	branch is in Sydney, they also have branches in the US which generates around 99% of their revenue. As part of his job, Joel also works with a ticketing 
	system, sorting by priority and marking as completed so the Project Managers can keep track. Due to the nature of his work, Joel coordinates a lot through 
	Zoom meetings, especially when working on integration, and performs peer code reviews and including sometimes debugging of software. As Joel works in a 
	small office, he only interacts with a small group of people such as the team supervisor, other developers, and sometimes the project managers. Joel rarely 
	has contact with clients unless following up a request for help or to receive feedback, and never interacts with the investors as this is the Project 
	Manager’s job. In Joel’s everyday work schedule, he mostly writes code for software, organises tickets, and attends meetings. Not all of Joel’s job is 
	easy-going. He finds code reviewing to be the most challenging aspect of his job as it can be quite boring when reviewing large amounts of code and can be 
	difficult to offer valuable feedback. Joel also likes to code when he isn’t at work, consequently he is currently working on a multiplayer gem matching 
	game and an automated scraper for 4Chan and 8Chan.
	<br>
	Joel loves working as a Software Developer, however, before joining this company he considered game development until he started writing his own software 
	and realised there are more opportunities for him to stay in Tasmania as a Software Developer as opposed to a Game Developer. Joel provided us with an 
	example of the work he does that he feels captures the essence of the IT industry. His first project with the company was a product integration to Salesforce 
	which existed six months prior to starting his current job, during a meeting he was asked how he thinks they should go about the Salesforce integration. When 
	he came onto the project it was mostly done but had some problems he helped resolve then it was submitted for security review by Salesforce, where it was 
	denied due to authentication issues. Joel came up with an idea and presented a prototype that creates pairs of keys, one public and one private. After 
	presenting this idea, they passed the security review. Salesforce then mentioned that it should be written as a canvas app, making all their work redundant 
	and now the entire project needs to be completely rewritten. According to Joel, this example captures the essence of the current IT industry; getting messed 
	around by external forces, time constraints, not being able to do things the way you want, and having to make do with what you have, much like most industries. 
	Joel has been a Software Developer for this company for around one year and he seems to really enjoy his work, a few of us in our group see Software Developer 
	as an ideal job and this interview has reinforced that for us.
