    <h1> IDEAL JOBS </h1>
    <br>
    <p> When it came to selecting an ideal job Bryce, Noah and Rhiannon had all initially selected the same role, that of Software Developer. Hannah 
    had chosen Cyber Security Analyst and Daniel listed a very specific job, Research Scientist with company called OpenAI.  These three jobs, while 
    being very different from each other, also have a lot of elements in common. Personal skills differed little between the three careers. The 
    importance placed on being able to communicate effectively, both orally and in written form, ranks very highly for all three jobs. The need to be 
    able to integrate well into a workgroup, no matter the size or project, is also very important. You must be able to organise yourself and your 
    workload effectively to succeed in these jobs. Attention to detail is important and presentation skills are required so that you can effectively 
    share your ideas with clients, employers, and co-workers. </p>
    <br>
    <p> There are also technical skills that are similar in both jobs. Knowledge of programming languages SQL, JavaScript and JAVA were the top three 
    requisites in the IT Specific Skills list from Burning Glass for all three jobs. Experience with operating systems also ranked highly, with Windows 
    and LINUX featuring predominantly on the list. The differences between them are predominantly down to the level of education required for each career. 
    Software Developers don’t necessarily require a degree or formal education, just a provable knowledge and experience with the programming languages 
    required by the employer. Cyber Security Analysts, often need a degree in IT, Cyber Security, or Computer Science. They must also have or be able to 
    quickly acquire an understanding of the required knowledge and industry specific laws and standards, as these differ from company to company, as well 
    as from country to country. Research Scientists need the highest level of education out of the three, a master’s degree or doctorate in either 
    Computer Science or a similar tech field. Their knowledge base must be more technical, with provable experience in machine learning, algorithms, and 
    computer architecture. They must also provide proof of research skills with either first author publications or projects.  </p>
    <br>
    <p> In conclusion, the basic skills for these roles are very similar. An understanding of IT technology and the industry is important. The need to be 
    able to work well and communicate with others is also important. The main difference for these roles is the level of further education required for 
    each job, mostly because of the technical skills required. </p>
