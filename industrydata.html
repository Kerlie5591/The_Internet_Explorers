	field was found online (Verma 2021). </p>

	<b style="color: yellow"> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </b>
	<br><br>
	<b> Bryce </b>
	<p> My ideal job is Software Developer, after reading the Burning Glass data, my opinion has still not changed. A lot of the general 
	and IT-specific skills required for my ideal job are all within the top section of the data. I still want to gain a career in programming 
	as I really enjoy writing code, especially seeing it finished and watching my work come to fruition, therefore my ideal job is still 
	Software Developer. </p>
	<br>
	<b> Hannah </b>
	<p> The Burning Glass data has not changed my opinion of my idea job. It appears that the field of cyber security is ranked within the list, and it 
	is currently a field growing in demand. Also, some of the more popular roles in the occupations list are positions which can improve further skills to 
	become a cyber security analyst and grow relevant experience. If it’s not possible to jump straight into the cyber security field, it will be possible 
	to develop the necessary skills and experience in other fields and use those assets to pursue my ideal job. </p>
	<br>
	<b> Noah </b>
	<p> After studying the burning glass data, I have still decided on software development to be my ideal job. Even though software development was low on 
	the list of jobs the other data could easily be compared to a job in software development. All the skills and languages required could all be 
	achieved in this position. At the end of the day, it is not about the quantity of the jobs going around but about the quality of them.  </p>
	<br>
	<b> Daniel </b>
	<p> Despite my ideal job not being represented in the Burning Glass data I still wish to be a research scientist at openAI. The field of machine 
	learning and data science is growing incredibly fast, and I don’t believe this was captured in the Burning Glass data. I still want to be in a company 
	at the forefront of research and development with the skills to assist in those tasks.  </p>
	<br>
	<b> Rhiannon </b>
	<p> No, my opinion of my ideal job has not changed. The Burning Glass data provided is already four years old and the IT industry has 
	evolved and improved since then. There are coding languages used today that weren’t listed, as well as IT roles that are becoming popular 
	and important in the field. I am still interested in pursuing a career as a Software Developer. </p>
