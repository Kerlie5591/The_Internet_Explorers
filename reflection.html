	<h3> Bryce </h3>
	<br>	
	<p> Our group meshed well together with great communication. We set our meetings and deadlines early and all completed our required sections 
	by the set deadlines. We started out well but needed to increase our pace towards the end, I feel we can improve on our motivation and priorities 
	during the festive seasons. I was surprised at the trust level involved when relying on everyone to meet deadlines. I learned that when working 
	in a group, managing deadlines and expectations requires a lot of communication. </p>
	<br><br>

	<h3> Hannah </h3>
	<br>	
	<p> I believe our group had fantastic communication. This had a positive effect on the group environment, and everyone was always respectful. 
	It was surprising that everyone was honest about their schedule, and everyone was respectful and cooperative with each other. Despite unexpected 
	occurrences all members strived to complete their assigned tasks. One thing we could improve is maintaining our pace with our studies. Especially 
	working through the pandemic, many of us seemed worn out and this presented a challenge.  </p>

	<h3> Daniel </h3>
	<br>	
	<p> Our group worked very well together, we were all motivated and supportive of each other. We effectively identified the project areas that 
	required the most effort and set deadlines early to get them out of the way. I was surprised by how much communication is required in a group setting 
	to organise deadlines and set workloads. I learned that meetings work a lot better when they are well organised with an agenda and chairperson. One 
	area we could have improved on is providing feedback on each otherâ€™s work. </p>
