	I am 30 years old and was born in Australia. I am Caucasian and Indigenous Australian, and I only speak English. I enlisted in the Australian 
	Army as an Advanced Medical Technician early in life. During my time in the Army, I received my Diploma in Nursing and Diploma in Paramedical 
	Science as well as other Certificates in the medical field. I went on to study my Bachelor of Nursing, and after discharging I completed my 
	Certificate IV in Business Management and my Certificate IV in Security Management. I love spending time with my small family, my wife Tanya 
	and daughter Katara. I enjoy living an active lifestyle and every week go skating, boating, or hiking as a family. I also enjoy online gaming 
	and reading fantasy novels. I love IT and enjoy building computers, I have dabbled in app and webpage creation; I quite enjoy programming and 
	app development. My current IT experience is limited, I have only ever pursued it as a hobby, never having worked in the field. I joined RMIT’s 
	Bachelor of Information Technology to learn as much as possible about IT and start a career that I will enjoy, I hope to gain the knowledge to 
	become a software developer or work in cyber security.

	My name is Hannah, I was born and raised in Sydney. I fluently speak Korean and lived in China for a short period of time just before the pandemic 
	to learn Chinese Mandarin. I enjoy playing music and majored in classical piano. During the pandemic, I started learning to play the guitar 
	on my own while watching YouTube tutorials. My favourite hobby is travelling and during peak holiday seasons, I am usually holiday-hopping. 
	My main interests in IT are Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence. During my studies in diploma of IT, I was interested by methods
	which cyber criminals use to infiltrate computers and access data as well as ways that could mitigate it. My interest in artificial 
	intelligence peaked after learning about Tesla’s revolutionary Autopilot features and the ethics attached to artificial intelligence.

	My name is Noah Etherington. I grew up in Hobart, Tasmania and started my working career as a chef. My hobbies include Gaming, Social sports, Listening
	to music and most importantly bush walking. I am currently running a fundraising campaign for the Cancer Council Australia in support of my terminally 
	ill grandmother, for every Tasmanian Abel I summit I will be donating $10 to the foundation in hopes to raise awareness and aid in prevention of the 
	illness. My interest in IT stems from building custom computers for friends and family and I hope to develop further knowledge in the software side of 
	computing. The Internet Explorers is a team made up of myself, Daniel, Hannah, and Bryce (Name creator) and we hope to aid each other in upcoming projects.

	Hi, I’m Rhiannon, I live and work in Port Augusta, South Australia. I work full time as a data administrator in the rail industry. I’m a wife, mum, and 
	dog owner. In my spare time I like to create art and watch movies. I grew up in the 80’s and 90’s around computers and AV technology inspired by my dad 
	who had a love for all things IT. During quarantine I had a conversation with my best friend who is currently a year and a half into her Batchelor of 
	Social Work which she is completing online. I looked into what was now on offer and seeing that a wide variety of IT courses were available to me I jumped 
	at the chance. I am interested in software development, learning more about computer programming and cyber security.
